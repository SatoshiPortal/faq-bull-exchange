# How to export my transaction history ?

From your Bull Bitcoin dashboard, you can view your recent transaction history. To access your full transaction history, click on “View All” or go directly to https://app.bullbitcoin.com/txs.

You can sort your transactions using the filters at the top left of the screen to narrow down the results if needed. Once ready, click the Export button at the top right of the page to download a CSV file of your transactions.

The CSV file can be opened with any spreadsheet application, such as Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice. If necessary, use the “Split text to columns” feature in your spreadsheet app and select Semicolon (;) as the delimiter to organize your data into columns.
