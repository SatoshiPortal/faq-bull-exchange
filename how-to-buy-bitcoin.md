# How to buy bitcoin ?

## Basic Method

Bull Bitcoin is an automated OTC desk — there is no order book, and we do not match buyers with sellers. When you buy Bitcoin on Bull Bitcoin, you are purchasing it directly from us. Bull Bitcoin is non-custodial, which means that once you complete a purchase, the Bitcoin is sent immediately to your own Bitcoin wallet.

Watch our step-by-step tutorial: How to buy Bitcoin on Bull Bitcoin ?

### Overview

Buying Bitcoin on Bull Bitcoin is a simple 3-step process:

1. Fund your account
2. Set up a Bitcoin wallet
3. Create a Buy Order

### Step 1: Fund Your Account

Before buying Bitcoin, you need to add funds to your Bull Bitcoin account balance. When you make a purchase, the funds will be deducted from your balance.

The available funding methods depend on your country. You can also fund your account with Bitcoin, which is equivalent to selling Bitcoin into your account balance.

Supported countries and currencies:

- Canada (CAD)
- Europe (EUR)
- Mexico (MXN)
- Costa Rica (CRC)
- Argentine pesos (ARS)

### Step 2: Set Up a Bitcoin Wallet

Since Bull Bitcoin is non-custodial, you must have your own Bitcoin wallet before making a purchase. You cannot create a Buy Order without providing a Bitcoin address, because the Bitcoin is sent directly to your wallet as soon as the order is confirmed.

Make sure to download, install, and secure your wallet before proceeding.

Recommended Bitcoin Wallets:

- Bull Bitcoin Wallet (for mobile phones)

### Step 3: Create a Buy Order

Creating a Buy Order involves four steps:

1. Select the amount of fiat you want to spend, or the exact amount of Bitcoin you want to receive.
2. Choose the payment network:
   - Bitcoin Network (regular Bitcoin transaction)
   - Lightning Network
   - Liquid Network
3. Enter your Bitcoin address (unless using the Lightning Network).
4. Confirm your order.

Once confirmed, your Bitcoin will be sent directly to your wallet.

## Advanced methods

In addition to the basic method of buying Bitcoin, Bull Bitcoin offers advanced tools that let you automate Bitcoin purchases and stack sats without constantly logging in. These methods are ideal for anyone looking for a hands-off, consistent approach to Bitcoin accumulation.

### Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)

Bull Bitcoin’s DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) feature allows you to automatically buy Bitcoin hourly, daily, or weekly. Instead of trying to time the market, DCA ensures consistent accumulation regardless of price swings. It also helps you avoid emotional decisions like FOMO purchases during price spikes.

#### Why Use DCA?

- Perfect for newcomers seeking a simple, hands-off entry into Bitcoin
- Ideal for long-term holders who don’t want to overthink market timing
- Helps maintain consistency even if you forget or procrastinate

#### How to Set Up DCA on Bull Bitcoin:

1. From your dashboard, toggle Recurring Buy (DCA).
2. Enter the amount you want to buy and select the frequency (hourly, daily, or weekly).
3. Choose the network: Bitcoin On-chain, Lightning, or Liquid, and provide your wallet address. Amounts under 0.001 BTC will be automatically sent to your Liquid or Lightning address.
4. Confirm the recurring buy — Bull Bitcoin will automatically purchase Bitcoin for you and send it directly to your wallet.

⚠️ Make sure your account balance covers your DCA amount, or purchases will be skipped and retried at the next scheduled interval.

#### How to Set Up Autobuy:

1. From your dashboard, toggle Autobuy to “On.”
2. Provide a Bitcoin address and either a Lightning or Liquid address.

   - Under 0.001 BTC → Lightning or Liquid
   - Over 0.001 BTC → Bitcoin on-chain
