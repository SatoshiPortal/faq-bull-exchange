## Send Fiat Payment: A Different Way to Sell

## Overview

Sending fiat payments with Bull Bitcoin is a simple 4-step process:

1. Select or add a recipient
2. Create a Sell Order
3. Add a description
4. Send the Bitcoin

### Step 1: Select or Add a Recipient

Before sending a fiat payment, you need to choose who will receive the money:

- Select an existing recipient from your list.
- Or add a new recipient by entering their bank information.

⚠️ Important: The person you pay does not need to sign up with Bull Bitcoin. They do not even need to know that you are paying them with Bitcoin.

### Step 2: Create a Sell Order

This part works just like selling Bitcoin:

- Select the amount you want to send, either in Bitcoin or in fiat currency.
- Choose the network you will use to send your Bitcoin:
  - Bitcoin Network (on-chain)
  - Lightning Network
  - Liquid Network

### Step 3: Add a Description

You can add a description for the bank transfer, which will appear in your recipient’s account:

- Do not mention Bitcoin. Adding the word “Bitcoin” can trigger increased scrutiny from banks.
- Leave blank if you don’t want to include a description.

### Step 4: Send the Bitcoin

Finally, send the Bitcoin from your wallet to Bull Bitcoin.

## Exchange Rate Lock-In

The exchange rate is guaranteed as soon as your payment is detected by Bull Bitcoin:

- Bitcoin Network (on-chain): when the unconfirmed transaction appears in the mempool of our Bitcoin node.
- Lightning Network: when the Lightning payment is detected by our Lightning node.
- Liquid Network: when the unconfirmed transaction appears in the mempool of our Liquid node.

This ensures that the recipient will receive the exact amount of fiat indicated when you created your payment.
