# How to fund my Bull Bitcoin balance in Costa Rica (CRC & USD) ?

## Step 1: Click on Deposit Funds
From your Bull Bitcoin dashboard, click the “Deposit Funds” button to get started.

## Step 2: Select Country
Choose Costa Rica as your country of funding.

## Step 3: Choose Your Funding Method
For Costa Rica, there are three main options depending on your currency and preference:

- SINPE Transfer (Colones): Use Costa Rica’s SINPE system to transfer CRC from your bank account. Transfers are generally fast and reliable, often settling within minutes to a few hours.
- CRC IBAN Transfer: Send Costa Rican colones using your CRC IBAN account. Note that this IBAN is specific to Costa Rica and is not the same as the European SEPA IBAN.
- USD IBAN Transfer: Send US Dollars using a Costa Rican USD IBAN account. Again, this is specific to Costa Rica and functions differently than SEPA IBANs.

## A Few Notes on the Process and Experience

- Verified Account Required: Funding via SINPE or IBAN requires a fully verified Bull Bitcoin account. Verification helps ensure smooth processing and compliance.
- Processing Time: SINPE transfers typically settle quickly, often within minutes. CRC or USD IBAN transfers may take 1–2 business days depending on your bank.
- Safety and Reliability: All transfers are processed through regulated Costa Rican banking channels. Bull Bitcoin provides the necessary account numbers, IBAN, recipient names, and references to ensure accurate deposits.
