# How to Fund Your Bull Bitcoin Balance in Costa Rica (CRC & USD)

## Step 1: Click on Deposit Funds
From your Bull Bitcoin dashboard, click the **“Deposit Funds”** button to get started.

## Step 2: Select Country
Choose **Costa Rica** as your country of funding.

## Step 3: Choose Your Funding Method
For Costa Rica, there are three main options depending on your currency and preference:

- **SINPE Móvil Transfer (Colones):** Use Costa Rica’s SINPE Móvil system to transfer CRC from your bank account. Transfers are instant and reliable, often settling within minutes.  
  *Note: You only need to be SINPE_VERIFIED, which requires an email and a phone number registered with SINPE Móvil.*

- **CRC IBAN Transfer:** Send Costa Rican colones using your CRC IBAN account. This IBAN is specific to Costa Rica and is not the same as a European SEPA IBAN.

- **USD IBAN Transfer:** Send US Dollars using a Costa Rican USD IBAN account. This is also specific to Costa Rica and functions differently than SEPA IBANs.

## A Few Notes on the Process and Experience

- **Processing Time:** SINPE Móvil transfers typically settle quickly, often within minutes. CRC or USD IBAN transfers may take 1–2 business days depending on your bank.  
- **Safety and Reliability:** All transfers are processed through regulated Costa Rican banking channels. Bull Bitcoin provides the necessary account numbers, IBANs, recipient names, and references to ensure accurate deposits.
