# How to Fund the Bull Bitcoin Balance with EUR ?

## Step 1: Click on Deposit Funds
From your Bull Bitcoin dashboard, click the “Deposit Funds” button to begin.

## Step 2: Select Country
Choose “Europe”.

## Step 3: Choose Your Funding Method
For EUR accounts, funding is done through the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) system:

- SEPA: Standard euro transfer, fast and cost-effective within the SEPA region.
- SEPA Instant: When supported by your bank, deposits are credited almost instantly, 24/7.

## A Few Notes on the Process and Experience

- Verified Account Required: Funding via SEPA requires that your Bull Bitcoin account is verified.
- Supported Countries: Your bank must be located within the SEPA region. The full list of countries can be found on the [European Central Bank website](https://www.ecb.europa.eu).
- Processing Time: Standard SEPA transfers usually settle within 1–2 business days. With SEPA Instant, funds can arrive within seconds if supported by your bank.
- Safety and Efficiency: SEPA payments are regulated, ensuring the same reliability as domestic transfers across the EU and several non-EU countries.
