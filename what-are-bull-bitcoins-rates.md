# What are Bull Bitcoin’s rates ?

## How Does Bull Bitcoin Make Money?

Bull Bitcoin’s pricing works like a traditional currency exchange:

- When you buy Bitcoin: Bull Bitcoin sells its own inventory to you at a slightly higher price than the price at which it acquired the Bitcoin. The difference is called the markup, which is how Bull Bitcoin earns revenue.
- When you sell Bitcoin: Bull Bitcoin buys your Bitcoin at a slightly lower price than the price at which it will resell them. You are, in effect, supplying Bitcoin to Bull Bitcoin. The difference between the buying price and the resale price is the markup, which is also how Bull Bitcoin earns revenue.

## Free Bitcoin Withdrawals

When you buy Bitcoin, you do not pay Bitcoin network fees (mining fees). Bull Bitcoin covers these fees for you.

## Express Withdrawal Network Fees

If you choose to opt out of scheduled withdrawals and select an express withdrawal, you must pay the current Bitcoin network fee required by miners.

- Bull Bitcoin does not collect these fees—they go directly to miners.
- Fees are calculated based on the current network conditions to confirm transactions within 1–2 blocks.
