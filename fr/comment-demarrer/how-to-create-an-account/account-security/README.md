# Account Security

## Why secure your account?

If an unauthorized person gets access to your account, they will be able to do the following:

* View and export the personal information you have provided for identity verification.
* View and export your transaction history.
* Conduct Bitcoin transactions using your identity.
* Steal funds from your Bull Bitcoin account balance by purchasing Bitcoin using your account and sending it to an unauthorized Bitcoin address.

## Account security basics

* Choose a unique [password](../../../../en/how-to-get-started/how-to-create-an-account/account-security/password.md) and keep it safe
* Secure your email account
* Use [Two-Factor authentication (2FA)](../../../../en/how-to-get-started/how-to-create-an-account/account-security/two-factor-authentication.md)

Having solid account security is one way to protect against Scammers and Fraud
