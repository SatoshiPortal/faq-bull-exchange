# Recurring Buys (DCA)

The Recurring Buy is a feature that allows users to schedule and automate Bitcoin purchases. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a strategic approach wherein a user consistently allocates the same dollar amount to purchase Bitcoin, irrespective of its current market price.

When applied over a prolonged period, the average acquisition price of Bitcoin approaches the mean market price over that duration. The Recurring Buy feature seamlessly incorporates the Dollar Cost Averaging strategy by executing a “Buy Bitcoin” order based on the user's chosen interval, directly debiting the account balance and forwarding the acquired Bitcoin to the specified wallet.

Activation: The scheduling of these recurring transactions will commence immediately upon clicking "schedule".

Frequency Options: Users have the flexibility to determine the frequency of their purchases. Options include hourly, daily, or custom intervals, such as every 4 hours or every 5 days.

Initial Transaction: Upon activating the Recurring Buy, the first transaction is executed promptly. Subsequent transactions are scheduled based on the first minute of the hour following this initial transaction.

Order invoice page: When a Recurring Buy transaction is executed, it creates a Buy Bitcoin order, identically to standard “Buy Bitcoin” orders.

Flexibility and Cancellation: Users can alter the Bitcoin address for each transaction at their discretion. The Recurring Buy feature can be canceled at any point without any associated penalties.

Recurring Buy duration:

A Recurring Buy schedule will persist until:

* The user's balance is insufficient to support the next transaction, upon which the schedule will automatically terminate without any penalties.
* The user reaches their specified target amount.
* The user elects to halt the Recurring Buy feature.

Account Balance Requirements:Users are not obligated to maintain a balance that covers the entirety of the target amount for the Recurring Buy schedule.
