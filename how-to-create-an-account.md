Bitcoin on your balance sheet ? We’ve got you covered.

In addition to a personal account, you may also create a separate business account with Bull Bitcoin. Many of our clients maintain both, and that is perfectly acceptable.

### Why Choose a Business Account ?

A Business Account allows you to:

- Use bank accounts registered in your corporation’s name
- Receive transaction receipts that include your company’s name
- Access higher transaction limits
- Benefit from priority customer support
- Use specialized tools for managing Bitcoin within your business operations

This makes a Business Account ideal for companies integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategy.

### What Changes with a Business Account ?

When you switch to a Business Account, you gain:

- Higher limits for transactions
- Enhanced security features
- Detailed financial reporting
- Multi-user management capabilities

## Business Account Verification

Because corporate accounts require additional due diligence, onboarding may take slightly longer — usually no more than one or two business days. To complete the process, you will need to provide standard business documentation.
