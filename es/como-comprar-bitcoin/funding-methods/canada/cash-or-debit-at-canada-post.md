# Cash or Debit at Canada Post

{% hint style="info" %}
Funding an account via Cash or Debit requires a [Limited Account](../../../../en/how-to-get-verified/verification-basics/2.-limited/).
{% endhint %}



Once you have the Limited account level, head to "Fund your account" and select the "Cash or Debit at Canada Post" option. There, you will find instructions on how to use this feature.

For funding your account via the Cash or Debit at Canada Post method, you need a **Limited status account.** For that, you must provide your name, a verified email address, and a verified phone number.
