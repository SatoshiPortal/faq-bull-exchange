#### How can I export my orders in a csv file?

If you need a CSV file of your orders, go to ‘My Account’ - ‘Financials, and click on ‘Export my orders’.

Once downloaded, you can open the csv file with any spreadsheet app like Excel, Google Sheet or LibreOffice. Then, go to ‘Data’ - ‘Split text to columns’ and select Semicolon or ; to split the text in columns.
