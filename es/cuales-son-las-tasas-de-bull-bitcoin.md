# ¿Cuáles son las tasas de Bull Bitcoin?

## Our pricing model works like traditional currency exchanges

* When you buy Bitcoin, Bull Bitcoin sells its own inventory of Bitcoin to you. The price at which we sell Bitcoin to you is slightly higher then the price of Bitcoin at which we acquired it. The difference between those two prices is called our **markup** and that his how we make money.&#x20;
* When you sell Bitcoin, Bull Bitcoin will buy the Bitcoin off of you at a slightly lower price then the price at which we will resell them. You are, in essence, our supplier of Bitcoin. The difference between the price we pay for your Bitcoin and the price at which we sell it is called our **markup** and that is how we make money.

## Free account funding

* Bull Bitcoin does not collect fees from you when you fund your Bull Bitcoin account.
* It is possible that your bank will charge you fees for those transacitons. We are not responsible for those fees.

## Free Bitcoin withdrawals

* When you buy Bitcoin on Bull Bitcoin, you do not have to pay Bitcoin withdrawal fees.
* In other words, Bull Bitcoin pays the Bitcoin network fee (also known as "mining fee) for you.
* In order to cut down on Bitcoin network fee costs, Bull Bitcoin will "batch together" the Bitcoin withdrawals of many of its users. In practice, tihs means that we are sending Bitcoin to multiple customers withing a single Bitcoin transaction.
* Our batched bitcoin withdrawals usually happen ever 2 or 3 hours.&#x20;
* Lightning Network based withdrawals are always free. Bull Bitcoin will pay the Lightning Network routing fees for you.&#x20;
* Liquid Network based withdrawals are always free. Bull Bitcoin will pay the Liquid Network federation fees for you.&#x20;

## Batching

## Express withdrawal network fees

* If you decide to opt-out of scheduled withdrawals and select an express withdrawal, you will have to pay the Bitcoin network fee (aka "mining fee").
* Bull Bitcoin does not collect these transaction fees, they are sent directly to the Bitcoin miners.
* The amount of the express withdraw network fee is not decided by Bull Bitcoin, it is the always the current Bitcoin network fee required by Bitcoin miners to confirm a Bitcoin transaction with 1-2 blocks.&#x20;
