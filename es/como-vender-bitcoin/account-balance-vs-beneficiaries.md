# Account balance vs beneficiaries

## Choosing where to receive the fiat money

Do you want the fiat money to be added to your Bull Bitcoin account, or do you want the fiat money to immediately be sent to an external bank account or beneficiary?

There is one major reason why you might want to sell Bitcoin and receive the money in your Bull Bitcoin account balance: **You want to buy the Bitcoin later.**

If you don't intend to buy the Bitcoin back later, you might as well just send the fiat money directly to a beneficiary, whether it is your bank account, someone else's bank account, or a biller.

{% hint style="info" %}
IMPORTANT: you are not allowed to use funds from your Bull Bitcoin account to send payments to a beneficiary other than yourself. Bull Bitcoin is not a bank. If you want to pay someone else, you must use the "Pay with Bitcoin" service directly and you must not sell Bitcoin to your account balance first.
{% endhint %}

## Withdrawing from your Bull Bitcoin account balance

After you have sold Bitcoin and received money into your Bull Bitcoin account balance, there are two things you can do:

1. You can buy Bitcoin back later from your account balance
2. You can withdraw the funds from your account balance and send the funds to your bank account.
