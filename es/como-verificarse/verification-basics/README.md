## Source of Income and Income

Tell us your job description or how you make money. The general idea is that, for legal reasons, we need to have an idea of where you get your money and this source of income needs to be compatible with the transaction volumes you are doing.

Examples:

* _Accountant, engineer, trucker, etc._
* _Student with money from my parents_
* _I won the lottery_
* _I have an online business_
* _I sold my house_
* _I am retired with a pension_
* _I am an investor_

## What is identity document verification?

Generally, you need to provide a government-issued identity document as well as a selfie. This can be done using two methods:

1. **Automated identity verification:** this is the same across all countries
2. **Manual identity verification**: this is the same across all countries

## Our Know-Your-Client (KYC) Policy

For legal and security reasons, Bull Bitcoin may need to verify your identity before you can use Bull Bitcoin's services. Our philosophy is that **you shouldn't give more information than required for a particular service**. Please understand that:

* Not all services require the same levels of identity verification.
* Not all identity verification requirements are the same depending on your country.
* Identity verification may not be required for some services depending on the transaction amounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you aren't sure what identity verification you need for a particular service, just try to use that service! If you've given enough information, you'll be able to use it. If you haven't, we'll tell you what is missing.
{% endhint %}

To learn about the identity verification levels, and what services will available to you, go to the [**Identity Verification**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZusqoU4usOW4a9t3Oekf/s/0pgvipnHFTAYDAhihBQH/~/changes/42/getting-started/identity-verification) section of this guide.

## What are the Verification Requirements?

The Verification requirements are the same across all countries.

1. **First and last name**: your legal name as it appears on your bank account
2. **Phone number must be verified**: a phone number we can reach out at
3. **Your residential address**: where you live
4. **Your date of birth**: as it appears on your passport
5. Your occupation / source of income
6. Identity document verification

## What is occupation or source of income?

Tell us your job description or how you make money. The general idea is that, for legal reasons, we need to have an idea of where you get your money and this source of income needs to be compatible with the transaction volumes you are doing

Examples:

* Accountant, engineer, trucker, etc.
* Student with money from my parents
* I won the lottery
* I have an online business
* I sold my house
* I am retired with a pension
* I am an investor

## Automated vs Manual verification

Generally, you need to provide a government-issued identity document as well as a selfie. This can be done using two methods:

1. **Automated identity verification:** this is the same across all countries
2. **Manual identity verification**: this is the same across all countries
