# Business Accounts

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have both a Personal Account and a separate Business Account, that's not a problem!
{% endhint %}

## Why Use a Business Account?

Using a Business Account instead of a Personal Account will allow you to use bank accounts registered in your corporation's name, and all transaction receipts will include the name of your corporation. A business account on Bull Bitcoin offers higher transaction limits, priority support, and specialized tools for managing Bitcoin transactions, ideal for businesses integrating Bitcoin into your operations.&#x20;

## What Will Change?

Switching to a business account provides higher limits, enhanced security, detailed reporting, and multi-user management capabilities.

## Business Account Verification

Corporate accounts require a little bit more customer due diligence. On-boarding may take a little bit longer but no longer than a day or two. To upgrade, complete the [verification process](../../../en/how-to-get-verified/business-verification.md) by providing additional business documentation.
