## Security basics

* When choosing a password, **do not reuse the same password** you use for another website. This is very important. Choose a unique password!
* Do not share your password with anyone else. Ideally, keep it in a secure password manager, or completely offline.

## Tips for Creating a Secure Password

1. **Use a Long Password**:
   * Aim for at least 12 characters. The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.
2. **Include a Mix of Characters**:
   * Use a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, \*).
3. **Avoid Common Words and Phrases**:
   * Don't use easily guessable words or phrases like "password," "123456," or "qwerty."
4. **Avoid Personal Information**:
   * Do not include easily accessible personal information such as your name, birthdate, or address.
5. **Use a Passphrase**:
   * Combine unrelated words into a phrase. For example, "BlueHorse!77Cloud\*Sky" is more secure than a single word.
6. **Use Unique Passwords for Different Accounts**:
   * Never reuse passwords across multiple sites. If one account is compromised, others are still secure.
7. **Consider Using a Password Manager**:
   * [Password managers](../../../../en/faq/account-issues/what-is-a-password-manager.md) can generate and store complex passwords for you, so you don't have to remember them.

#### Examples of Secure Passwords

1. **Randomly Generated**:
   * `J8&gF3z!rT$2Kq9`
   * `4%ZpT7@mN1*Vw6X`
2. **Using a Passphrase**:
   * `Sunny!Day$In^June45`
   * `Purple#Mountain@Horse21`
3. **Combination of Words and Characters**:
   * `Coffee@Rain!92Sunrise`
   * `Book*Tree#123!Moon`

#### Additional Tips

* **Regularly Update Passwords**:
  * Change your passwords periodically, especially if you suspect a breach.
* **Enable** [**Two-Factor Authentication**](../../../../en/how-to-get-started/how-to-create-an-account/account-security/two-factor-authentication.md) **(2FA)**:
  * Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app.
* **Be Wary of Phishing**:
  * Be cautious of emails or messages asking for your password. Always verify the source before entering your credentials.
* **Check for Breaches**:
  * Use tools like "[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)" to check if your email or password has been part of a data breach.

By following these tips and using the examples as a guide, you can create strong, secure passwords that help protect your online accounts from unauthorized access.
