### Overview

Selling Bitcoin on Bull Bitcoin is a simple 3-step process:

1. Create a Sell Order.
2. Select the destination
3. Send the Bitcoin

### Step 1: Create a Sell Order

To sell Bitcoin, start by creating a Sell Order. This involves:

- Select the amount you want to sell, either in Bitcoin or in fiat currency.
- Choose the network for sending your Bitcoin:
  - Bitcoin Network
  - Lightning Network
  - Liquid Network

### Step 2: Select the Destination

You need to choose where the resulting fiat currency will go:

- Bank account — the fiat is sent directly to your own bank account.

⚠️ Important: You cannot send funds from your Bull Bitcoin account balance to someone else. For third-party payments, use the “Send Fiat Payment” service.

### Step 3: Send the Bitcoin

Finally, send the Bitcoin from your wallet to Bull Bitcoin.

## Exchange Rate Lock-In

The exchange rate is guaranteed as soon as your payment is detected by Bull Bitcoin:

- Bitcoin Network (on-chain): when the unconfirmed transaction appears in the mempool of our Bitcoin node.
- Lightning Network: when the Lightning payment is detected by our Lightning node.
- Liquid Network: when the unconfirmed transaction appears in the mempool of our Liquid node.

This ensures you know exactly how much fiat you will receive before the transaction confirms.
