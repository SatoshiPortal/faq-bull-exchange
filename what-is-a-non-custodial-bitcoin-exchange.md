# What is a non-custodial Bitcoin Exchange ?

## Self-Custody: Your Bitcoin, Your Control

At Bull Bitcoin, we are never custodians of your Bitcoin. Our platform does not host a Bitcoin wallet for you — you buy, sell, and spend bitcoins directly from your own wallet. This approach ensures that you retain full control over your bitcoins at all times.

Not your keys, not your coins.

We strongly encourage all users to store their bitcoins in a personal wallet rather than leaving them on an exchange. Until you control the private key, you do not truly control your Bitcoin.

## Top 7 Reasons to Self-Custody

1. Custodial exchanges are high-value targets for hackers.
2. Your own wallet is far more secure than any exchange wallet.
3. Exchanges might not actually hold your Bitcoin.
4. You’re protected from confiscation by authorities or intermediaries.
5. Preserve your privacy by controlling your own funds.
6. Nobody can censor you if you self-custody.
7. Self-custody empowers you and makes you a sovereign individual.
