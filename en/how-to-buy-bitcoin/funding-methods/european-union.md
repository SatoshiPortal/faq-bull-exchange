Thanks to the [**Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)**](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html)**,** cashless euro payments can be made through credit transfers and direct debits across the European Union and several non-EU countries. These transactions are fast, safe, and efficient, just like domestic payments.
