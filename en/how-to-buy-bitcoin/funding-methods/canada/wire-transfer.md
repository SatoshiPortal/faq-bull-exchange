# Wire Transfer



{% hint style="info" %}
Funding an account via Wire Transfer requires a [Verified Account](../../../how-to-get-verified/verification-basics/3.-verified/).
{% endhint %}

Also called Money Transfer, a Wire Transfer is the best way to send amounts over $10,000 CAD. However, you will likely have to go to the bank in person in order to initiate the transfer.

To fund your account via wire transfer, simply upgrade your account to the ‘Verified’ level. To upgrade your account to the Verified Level, go to 'My account' and follow the steps in ‘Next Step’.

**To prevent fraud, we may request an advanced KYC, such as ID or selfie.**

If you see a message saying that your account is restricted, don’t worry, this only means that an advanced KYC is required. Simply contact us via your account internal messages box to let us know.
