# Self-Custody

## **What is a Non-Custodial Bitcoin exchange?**

Non-custodial means that we are never custodians of your bitcoins. There is no hosted Bitcoin wallet in the application. You Buy, Sell or Spend bitcoins directly with your own Bitcoin wallet. Our services are designed to let you retain full control of your bitcoins during the process.

> **Not your keys - not your coins.**

We have always advised Bitcoin users to keep their bitcoins in their own Bitcoin wallet, rather than in an exchange wallet. You do not control your bitcoins until you control the private key.
