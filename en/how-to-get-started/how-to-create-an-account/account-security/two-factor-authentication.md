## **What is Two-Factor Authentication?**

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a smartphone or hardware token). By combining these two factors, 2FA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access to accounts and sensitive information.

## **Why is Two-Factor Authentication Important?**

2FA is crucial because it significantly reduces the risk of account breaches and unauthorized access. Even if a password is compromised through phishing, data breaches, or other means, the second factor—such as a code sent to your phone—provides an additional barrier for attackers. This enhanced security measure helps protect personal information, financial data, and other sensitive content, making it a vital tool in safeguarding your online presence.
