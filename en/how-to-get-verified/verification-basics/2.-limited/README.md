When a customer uses Bull Bitcoin for the first time, they are prompted to enter an email address and set up a password. This is called **Level Registered.** This level does not allow any transaction.

## Requirements

Limited verification means that we have not verified your identity, but we have still collected some information about you:

1. Verified email address
2. Verified phone number
3. First and Last name

## What does Limited Verification allow me to do?

### For Costa Rica

❌ You can't sell more than $1000 worth of Bitcoin per day&#x20;
