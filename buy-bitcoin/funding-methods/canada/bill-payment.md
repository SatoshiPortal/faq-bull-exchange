**Important Information**

Bull Bitcoin’s official name (Satoshi Portal Inc.) will no longer appear on your bank records if you use this payment method and, from now on, when you use e-transfers. Don’t worry! This is completely normal. Unlike with wire transfers and previously with e-transfers, payments sent to Bull Bitcoin will now be going through an intermediary payment processor.

Inbound payments are available for most Canadian bank accounts. At Bull Bitcoin, there are no transaction limits on Inbound Bill Payments. Bill payments should be scheduled well in advance of any recurring buys to ensure smooth stacking. Payments will be credited to your account within 2-3 business days. Our Support team will be on standby to help you get set up and answer any questions you may have.
