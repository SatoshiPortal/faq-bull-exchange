# Email Money Transfer

## Verification Required

To fund your account via an Email Money Transfer, wire transfer and Desjardins transfer, simply upgrade your account to the ‘Verified’ level.

**To prevent fraud, we may request an advanced KYC, such as ID or selfie**.

Once approved, go to ‘**Fund my account**’ and follow the instructions.

You can fund your account as soon as your verification level is "verified".
