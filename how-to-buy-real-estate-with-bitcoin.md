# Can I buy real estate with Bitcoin ?

You can use Bitcoin to buy real estate, even if the seller only accepts fiat currency. Bull Bitcoin allows you to sell your Bitcoin and have the proceeds sent directly to the necessary recipient—like a notary, lawyer, or escrow account—so the transaction meets legal and regulatory requirements.

## How it works

- Sell your Bitcoin via Bull Bitcoin: You initiate a sale from your self-custody wallet to your Bull Bitcoin account.
- Direct bank transfer: Once sold, Bull Bitcoin can transfer the funds in fiat directly to the notary, lawyer, or escrow account handling the property transaction. This ensures compliance and smooth settlement.
- Full control: You remain fully self-custodied until the point of sale, meaning your Bitcoin is never held by a third party unnecessarily.

## Important Considerations

- Verify your account: Make sure your Bull Bitcoin account is fully verified before attempting this type of transaction. Verification helps streamline all necessary documentation and ensures the process goes smoothly.
- Contact Bull Bitcoin in advance: Reach out to [prime@bullbitcoin.com](mailto:prime@bullbitcoin.com) before initiating the transaction. Their team will guide you and coordinate with the required parties to make the transfer seamless.
- Jurisdiction differences: Rules and procedures for using Bitcoin to buy real estate vary from one country to another. What works in Canada may not be exactly the same in Europe, Mexico, or elsewhere.

## Benefits

- Compliant transactions: No need to personally convert or transfer large amounts of fiat—the transfer goes directly to the authorized recipient.
- Privacy & security: You maintain self-custody of your Bitcoin until the sale, protecting your funds throughout the process.
- Flexibility: Works for both domestic and international real estate transactions where fiat is required.

Always confirm the bank transfer details with the notary, lawyer, or escrow before sending funds to ensure a smooth and legally compliant transaction.
