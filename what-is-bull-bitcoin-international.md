# What is Bull Bitcoin International ?

Bull Bitcoin, founded by Francis Pouliot in Canada in 2013, is the world’s longest-running Bitcoin-only exchange. Renowned for its technological expertise, unwavering Bitcoin-maximalist philosophy, commitment to the cypherpunk ethos, and operational excellence, Bull Bitcoin has earned a reputation as one of the most trusted and iconic brands in the Bitcoin-only ecosystem. Users consistently praise its exceptional customer support. Initially operating exclusively in Canada, the company expanded globally, entering Costa Rica in 2022, Europe in 2024, and Mexico in 2025.

Bull Bitcoin’s slogans, “Engineering Sovereignty” and “Own Your Money,” encapsulate its mission: to empower individuals worldwide with technical tools to reclaim financial sovereignty and hasten the decline of the fiat monetary system, which has undermined human civilization for over a century. Self-funded since its inception, Bull Bitcoin has never raised capital or taken loans, ensuring its independence and alignment with its core values.
