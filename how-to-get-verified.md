# How to get verified ?

## Why Verification is Required
Bull Bitcoin follows a strict Know-Your-Client (KYC) Policy for legal and security reasons. Verification ensures compliance, protects our users, and unlocks access to our services.
We only request the information necessary for the services you want to use.

## Verification for Individuals
### Required Information

- Full legal name (as it appears on your bank account)
- Verified phone number
- Residential address
- Date of birth
- Occupation / source of income
- Government-issued identity document + selfie

Examples of acceptable sources of income:
Accountant, engineer, truck driver, student supported by parents, small business, pension, investor, sale of property, lottery winnings.

### Automated Verification

- Upload a government-issued ID and a selfie via our secure partner (InCode).
- Fast and private: data is deleted after 30 days and never shared with third parties.
- Recommended method.

### Manual Verification

- Alternative for users who prefer not to use automated verification, or when automated verification fails.
- Required in some cases of enhanced due diligence.
- You must upload:
  - Identity document (passport, driver’s license, etc.)
  - Selfie holding your ID
  - Proof of residence (dated within last 3 months, e.g. utility bill, bank statement)
- Slower and requires more documents.
